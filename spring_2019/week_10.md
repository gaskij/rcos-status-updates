## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I created the mongo database and handled connecting to it remotely. This will be a lot 
better than using local JSON files. I also read into environment variables and hidind API keys from public
view.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to do even more to continue preparing my project for use at the beginning of the fall 
semester.

## Anything Blocking?

> All of the deadlines in the world are coming up.
