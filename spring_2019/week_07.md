## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I redid the CSS styling for the homepage, moving to a mostly Bootstrap
based implementation. This will make it easier for my webapp to adapt to different screen
sizes (mobile for example), and makes it much easier and less time consuming overall to 
style any new parts of the website.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to replace more PHP code with server-side JavaScript.

## Anything Blocking?

> I have to reason through all the PHP code, since most of it was written by a former group
member, and is not commented very thoroughly.
