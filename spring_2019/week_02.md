## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I researched Node.JS and Angular. Angular is actually a very useful tool and much  
more straightforward compared to jQuery. I played around with Angular 1.6, instead of using the latest  
versions of Angular. This version has a less steep learning curve.


## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan to work with Node to understand how to serve the website with data.

## Anything Blocking?

> N/A
