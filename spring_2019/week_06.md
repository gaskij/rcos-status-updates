## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I created a new directory to hold my files, and manually went through
and decided which ones to keep or discard/modify. Most of the client-side JavaScript has
remained, but all of the PHP pages are being rewritten.


## This Week's Plan

> Continue adapting to MEAN Stack.

## Anything Blocking?

> N/A
