## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I restructured my GitHub repository to better comply with best standard practices, and restructured \
> my local filesystem as well.


## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan to create the MongoDB database that the locations will be added to in order to search on campus.

## Anything Blocking?

> This will be my firat time using MongoDB, so I will look up some tutorials on how to get started. I aslo need to \
> get the existing location data from my previous group members.
