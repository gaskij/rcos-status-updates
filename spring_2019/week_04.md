## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I looked into porting my project over from a website to a mobile app.
This is especially important for my project since it is a map, which many people would
use on the go while trying to find their destination. I researched Progressive Web Apps,
and I feel that would be something to aim to model my project after.


## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to continue finding ways to make the website more mobile friendly.

## Anything Blocking?

> N/A
