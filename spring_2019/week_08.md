## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I worked on getting some of the PHP code for the backend functionality
implemented in JavaScript. I got some of it done, but I still have some more to do.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to replace even more PHP code with server-side JavaScript.

## Anything Blocking?

> I have to reason through all the PHP code, since most of it was written by a former group
member, and is not commented very thoroughly.
