## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I rewrote my homepage to be in HTML instead of PHP. Since I will be
using a MEAN stack structure, I do not need PHP in the project. I chose to make this 
switch to make the project easier to work on going forward, since there is only one 
language to write in (JavaScript).


## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to start writing routing code in Node, to begin to replace 
the PHP that had been previously used.

## Anything Blocking?

> Rearranging the files has started to get tricky, since some are old and others are new.
