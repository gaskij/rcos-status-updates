## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I practiced setting up a Node server, using npm modules, and a little bit of Express. The distinction  
between Node and Express can be a bit blurry, especially since both have similar methods that can do the same thing. I  
would like to learn more about what makes one favorable over the other in certain situations.


## This Week's Plan

> Adding more functionality to the backend.

## Anything Blocking?

> I still don't know much about MongoDB, so populating the database has been going slowly.
