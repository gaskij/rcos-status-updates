## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

However, the week prior, the main section not showing bug was fixed, and I was able to create multiple pages in the plugin itself.
Not much was done over this week, since it was the thanksgiving break and I had to leave early due to a death in the family.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

This week, we will have our large group presentation, so I plan to decide what part of the project I will present and
what will be most important to talk about. Since this project has just started this semester, there is not much to demo,
but we do have a very rough prototype that may or may not be shown.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology
